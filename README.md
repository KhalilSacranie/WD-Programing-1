# Abu Dhabi Tourism Site

## Development and Design Decisions

### Navigation
The navigation structure of the site is designed to be simple and intuitive. The main navigation links are placed in the header, allowing users to easily access the "Home", "History", and "Visit" pages. This consistent placement ensures that users can navigate the site without confusion.

### Layout
The layout of the site is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. The use of Bootstrap's grid system allows for a flexible and mobile-friendly design. Key sections such as the hero image, information sections, and cards are organized to provide a clear and engaging user experience.

### Colour Choices
The colour scheme is chosen to reflect the cultural and modern aspects of Abu Dhabi. The primary colours include shades of red and white, which are associated with the city's coastal location and modern architecture.

### Challenges Faced
1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the site looks good on all devices was a significant challenge. The use of media queries and Bootstrap's grid system helped address this issue.
2. **Consistent Styling**: Maintaining a consistent style across different pages required careful planning and the use of shared CSS classes.
3. **Image Optimization**: Balancing image quality and load times was crucial, especially for the hero images. Using appropriate image formats and sizes helped optimize performance.
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring that the site works well across different browsers required thorough testing and adjustments to the CSS and JavaScript.

**GIT SSH Keys**: A very large issue faced was the inability to push to the repository due to the lack of SSH keys. This was resolved by generating a new SSH key and adding it to the GitHub account. However, this could only be done very late into development, meaning that the project was not updated as frequently as it should have been.

### Conclusion
The development of the Abu Dhabi Tourism site involved careful consideration of navigation, layout, and colour choices to create an engaging and user-friendly experience. Overcoming challenges related to responsive design, consistent styling, image optimization, and cross-browser compatibility was essential to delivering a high-quality website.
